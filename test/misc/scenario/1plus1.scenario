Scenario: Adding 1 and 1
  As a calculator
  Given 1 is 1
  And 1 is not 0
  And 1 is less than 2
  And 1 is greater than -1
  When I add 1 and 1 together
  Then the result should be 2
  And not 3

Scenario: I put quotes in my spec
  As a developer
  When I write a double quote (") in my spec
  Then it should be escaped (\")
